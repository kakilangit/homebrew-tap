  caveats <<~EOS
    Shokirei is not notarized by Apple yet. This cask removes the quarantine
    flag from Shokirei.app so that it opens without a Gatekeeper prompt.

    The first capture asks for the Screen Recording permission, in
    System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording. From 0.3.1,
    updates keep it. Coming from 0.3.0 or earlier, grant it once more:
    remove the old Shokirei entry there first if captures still fail.
